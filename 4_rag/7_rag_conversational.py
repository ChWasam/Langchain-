#  <---------------------Complete story------------------------>
# All we are going to do is set up this retrieval chain 
# ALL this is going to do is we will be able to 
# 1. retrieve information from our vector store => history_aware_retriever
# 2. we want to have awareness of all the conversation we have uptil this point => question_answer_chain
# Based on information from the vector store and the conversation history, we will be able to generate a result
# FEW STEPS REQUIRED TO SET THIS UP
#   we need to be able to grab information from (vectorstore and conversation history)
#   We will be using create_stuff_documents_chain, which will take in the <(bunch of documents)related to current query  + (what is going on)>  and pass/feed them into the LLM 
#  We also need to give to the LLM  what is going on (conversation) so the LLM is aware of what it needs to do  
#  The above part will help in responding to questions
#  But where does this (document and conversation) come from ? 
#  For that we need to understand the history_aware_retriever
#  This is where we will start  working with a vector store 
# llm => doing the thinking and generating the response
#  retriever => to retrieve information from the vector store 
# contextualize_q_system_prompt => provides context for what's going on
# up to you to reformulate the question so that we can properly search for information outside vector store 
# Simply you are getting the question just rephrase it for the vector store so that we can retrieve the proper information
