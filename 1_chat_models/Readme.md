Gcloud CLI and gcloud  Infrastructure relationship => https://chatgpt.com/share/66e91f66-891c-800f-9c9a-2393c40e82a6


Google Cloud as the Server
Google Cloud services (such as Compute Engine, Storage, BigQuery, etc.) run on the Google Cloud infrastructure, which is essentially the "server" or the backend in this relationship.
When you send commands from your local gcloud CLI, they are processed by the Google Cloud servers. These servers then return results, error messages, or the status of your resources.

Communication Between CLI and Google Cloud
The gcloud CLI sends HTTP or HTTPS requests (via REST APIs) to Google Cloud's servers. These requests are based on the commands you run.
For example, if you run a command to create a VM (Virtual Machine), the CLI formats this request as an API call and sends it to the Google Cloud server, which then processes it and returns a response (e.g., VM created successfully).

Linking Code to Gcloud via CLI: When your codebase runs locally, it will likely use credentials and configuration from your local environment to authenticate with Google Cloud (often set up via the Gcloud CLI). For example, the CLI helps set up authentication tokens or environment variables that your code needs to authenticate to the Firestore service

Yes, authentication is the primary reason you'd need to set up the Gcloud CLI locally. The Gcloud CLI simplifies managing authentication, tokens, and environment configurations when working with Google Cloud services like Firestore, especially when running your code locally or automating tasks.

However, you're correct that you can manage most resources through the Google Cloud Console (browser interface). The Gcloud CLI mainly provides the following advantages:

Authentication Setup: It helps set up service account keys, authentication tokens, and access permissions that your code may need to interact with Google Cloud services.

Automation: The CLI allows you to automate repetitive tasks (like deploying your app, updating resources, creating Firestore databases) using scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

Local Development: When developing locally, your code will need credentials to authenticate with Google Cloud services (Firestore, Compute Engine, etc.). The CLI makes it easy to set up this local environment by managing authentication and service account credentials for you.

Advanced Control: Some advanced tasks, configurations, or debugging options might be easier to do in the CLI compared to the browser interface.
